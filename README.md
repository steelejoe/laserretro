# LaserRetro

This is where I will put all of the files related to the LaserRetro cyberdeck. I have been working on this off and on since the end of 2020. This is loosely based on the design of the Laser 50 computer from the early 80's. I acquired a Laser PC3 from a garage sale in the late 90's and recently found it again when moving. I thought the overal design aesthetic was cool (I love the V-Tech retro kids look) so I thought I would make something with a similar look but more functionality. I like the color scheme of the Laser 128 Apple clone as well so I am going with that color for the case. I decided to based mine around an Intel NUC because I wanted to be able to do some dev work and emulate higher powered devices. It would be relatively trivial to modify this design to incorporate other CPUs (e.g. an RbPi4+).
